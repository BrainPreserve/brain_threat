For example, brominated flame retardants used in electronics and foam are neurotoxic and accumulate in the body; high levels in adults have been correlated with cognitive defecits. Certain heavy metals (lead, cadmium) used as colorants or stabilizers in plastics directly impair neural function. These substances can trigger oxidative brain damage or neurotransmitter disturbances even at low doses over time.","Indirectly, plastic additives disrupt multiple body systems. Flame retardants and antimicrobials can disturb thyroid and sex hormones (altering metabolism and immune function), while antioxidants and stabilizers may generate toxic metabolites. Many plastic additives are long-lived persistent pollutants, contributing to chronic inflammation and organ damage. This cumulative toxic loadincreases risk for conditions like thyroid dysfunction, cancer, and cardiovascular disease, which in turn elevate the risk of cognitive decline in later life.","Employ AOPs for removal, restrict hazardous additives, enhance monitoring and remediation technologies",,additives,additives,
